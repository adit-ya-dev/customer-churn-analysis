 # Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn, helping businesses understand the factors contributing to customer turnover. By applying exploratory data analysis (EDA) and various machine learning techniques, the project provides insights that can guide targeted interventions to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.

## Objectives

- **Identify Key Factors**: Analyze customer data to pinpoint variables that significantly influence churn.
- **Predict Churn Probability**: Develop predictive models to estimate the likelihood of a customer leaving.
- **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer recommendations to enhance customer retention strategies based on analysis findings.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Database**: SQL, SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Cloud Services**: AWS

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered customer data from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature engineering.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized data distributions and relationships to uncover trends.
4. **Model Development**: Implemented machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict churn.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Derived actionable insights and suggested strategies to reduce churn.

## Results

- **Churn Rate**: Identified that approximately 26.54% of customers have churned.
- **Key Factors Influencing Churn**:
  - **Contract Type**: Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
  - **Tenure**: Shorter tenure correlates with higher churn rates.
  - **Senior Citizens**: Senior customers show a higher propensity to churn.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved a ROC-AUC score of XX%, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities.

## Recommendations

- **Customized Retention Campaigns**: Implement targeted strategies for high-risk customer segments.
- **Enhance Contract Offerings**: Provide incentives for customers to switch to longer-term contracts.
- **Improve Service Quality**: Address issues leading to dissatisfaction, especially among senior customers.
